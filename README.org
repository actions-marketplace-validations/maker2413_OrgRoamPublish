#+TITLE: OrgRoamPublish

This repo is built off of the [[https://github.com/maker2413/OrgPublish][OrgPublish]] image I also made. This repo just adds
the library files required to install org-roam to the OrgPublish image and then
also installs the org-roam package. The publish.el files has also been updated
to incorporate org-roam to the publish function.

* Running
  To run this docker image to publish your org-roam files to html you just have
  to run the following command:

  ~docker run -v <org-roam directory>:/opt/OrgFiles maker2413/OrgRoamPublish~
